                            <p>I am writing to express my dissatisfaction with the laptop I purchased from your store on June 30, 2023. The laptop is a ModelX Pro (Serial Number: XP7890123) that cost NPR 85,000.</p>
                            
                            <p>Upon unboxing and setting up the device, I discovered several issues that have significantly impacted my ability to use it for its intended purpose. These issues include:</p>
                            
                            <ol>
                                <li>The laptop overheats after just 30 minutes of normal usage</li>
                                <li>The battery drains completely within 2 hours despite the advertised 8-hour battery life</li>
                                <li>The screen shows discoloration on the right corner</li>
                            </ol>
                            
                            <p>I attempted to resolve these issues by contacting your technical support team on July 5, but the suggestions provided did not fix the problems. I visited your service center on July 10, where a technician confirmed these were hardware defects.</p>
                            
                            <p>According to your warranty policy and Nepal's Consumer Protection Act, I am entitled to either a replacement with a properly functioning unit or a full refund. I would prefer a replacement if you can assure me that the new laptop will be thoroughly tested before delivery.</p>
                            
                            <p>I have attached copies of my purchase receipt, warranty card, and the technical report from your service center. I request a prompt resolution within 7 business days.</p>

                        </div>
                        
                        <div class="letter-body">
                            <p>How are you doing? It's been almost three months since we last met at the college farewell party. I hope everything is going well with your new job in Chitwan. Life here in Kathmandu has been quite busy, but I've been meaning to write to you for a while now.</p>
                            
                            <p>I've got some exciting news to share! Remember how I kept talking about wanting to start a small photography business? Well, I've finally done it! Last month, I launched "Himalayan Frames" – my very own photography service. I've already booked three events for next month, including a wedding at Gokarna Forest Resort!</p>
                            
                            <p>The equipment was expensive, but my parents helped me with the initial investment. Dad was skeptical at first (you know how he is about "stable careers"), but he's slowly coming around after seeing some of the payments coming in. Mom is super supportive as always and has become my unofficial marketing manager, telling everyone in the neighborhood about my services!</p>
                            
                            <p>How's your job at the wildlife conservation center? Are you enjoying being surrounded by nature all day? Have you had any close encounters with the rhinos yet? I still can't believe you get to work in Chitwan National Park – that's literally my dream photography location!</p>
                            
                            <p>Oh, and you'll never guess who I ran into last week – Pranita! She's back from Australia after completing her master's degree and is now teaching at Kathmandu University. She asked about you and gave me her number to share with you. Here it is: 9841234567.</p>
                            
                            <p>I'm planning to visit Chitwan sometime in October for a personal photography project on wildlife. Would it be possible to stay with you for a few days? It would be great to catch up properly and maybe you could show me some good spots for wildlife photography!</p>
                            
                            <p>Write back soon and tell me all about your adventures in the jungle!</p>
